<h1> CONTRIBUTING </h1><br>
This is a group assignment for our Data Structure and Algorithm class, at the end of this project, we will have a program that records people who enter and remove people who leave a building in order to control the number of people in the building at the given moment. For the project to run smoothly, we created some guidelines in order to control how each group member contributes to the project. In the following part, we are going to talk about how we are going to go about pulling requests.

<h2>Pull request</h2>
Every pull request is first of all discussed in our group meeting where we share tasks and after completion of the task, every member is going to submit their request in another branch which is not main, after the team lead will check the work done by the member will create a pull request to put the new files in the main branch.

Every member must make sure that they update our README file in order to add all the libraries required in order to run any changes they made in the program and make sure they add a bibliography if there are any sources they used in doing their part of the task.
